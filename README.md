# TXAdminINGAME
This FiveM script doesnt use a framework, and it implements the txAdmin panel in game with the command /admin

As this is my first script, im kinda newbie there isnt a way to close the admin with GUI, u can close it by clicking F8 and typing closeadmin!

Have in mind as this is a client side script, every user can run the command, they cant login inside txAdmin tho.

Remember to change the index.html file, in the IFRAME add your txAdmin link! (No it cant be localhost)

Also have in mind you cant use the FiveM login as they reject the iframe request.

To have the latest features always make sure you are using the LATEST (not latest recommended nor optional) version of FXServer artifacts.

Ban feature expected to be implemented in txAdmin day 21.

No, i did not made txAdmin
